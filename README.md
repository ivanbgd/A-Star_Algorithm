# A-Star (A*) Algorithm

Several different implementations of the [A-Star search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), including a Bidirectional version.

The algorithm is used for graph traversal and for finding the shortest path in a graph.

It is an improved version of the [Dijkstra's Shortest path algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).
